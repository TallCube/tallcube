# March 10th Marketing Update

Milk Stork's marketing optimization project has officially jumped the gap from analysis to action.  We're happy to report that:

**Your first A/B test is a major success.** After a solid week of testing, we've reached a positive and statistically significant end result. We're ready to roll out the improved PYT to all users.

  - Overall conversion rate boost of +44%.
  - Results are statistically significant with a 97% chance of improving your conversion rate over an infinite number of users.
  - Test #1 ran a full seven days from Saturday to Friday.
  - More test users reached checkout. Once users chose a product they fell off at much lower rates during each of the following PYT steps -- including checkout.
  - Desktop users show the most positive sales impact.
  - Mobile users appear to buy more often but a larger sample is needed to confirm. This is due to universally low mobile sales expectations and is not a consequence of this test in particular.
  
|Version|Step-1 Unique Views|Total Sales|Conversion Rate|Improvement|
| ----- | -------- | ---- | --- | --- |
| Control |      652  |  65  |  9.9%   | -- |
| Test #1 |     287   |   41 |   14.3%  | **+44%** |

**The second A/B test is staged and ready to begin active testing.** Round Two is a long series of load-speed and user-experience optimizations focused on improving sales within your largest and most under-performing visitor segment: mobile users.  We can launch this test once the first test's changes have been adopted into the main website.

**Your third A/B test will be a dedicated product page and is in active development.** The overwhelmingly positive results of our first test give us reason to believe that our focus on improving product clarity produces meaningful sales results.  We're expanding our dedication to product copy by developing a new product demonstration and explanation page. It will fit between the homepage and Plan Your Trip. This page is likely to feature your new product video.

Please see the attached wire-frame for a conceptual first-look into the product page in development.

### Action Items

We need your assistance with the items below:

  1. We require your written approval in order to roll out the first test's changes to the live website. A simple "Yes!" will work!
  2. Please share Facebook page permissions with Tall Cube. Sarah or I will be in touch soon with instructions.
  3. Please forward any customer service reports and/or metrics you have available. Doing so will help us improve product clarity and estimate Click-To-Call viability.

The next few weeks will be packed with new insights, performance gains, and creative dynamite. We're excited and honored to help take Milk Stork to new levels.

Thank you,

Wes
